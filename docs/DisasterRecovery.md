## 🔧 **Recovery Procedures**

### **Level 1-2: Service Recovery**

#### **Automated Self-Healing Recovery**
```bash
# Triggered automatically by monitoring system
./tools/monitor.sh --auto-recovery

Automated Recovery Sequence:

Phase 1 - Service Restart (1-2 minutes):
1. Detect service failure or performance degradation
2. Create emergency backup: ./tools/create-full-backup.sh --emergency
3. Attempt graceful service restart: docker compose restart
4. Wait for health checks to pass (30 seconds)
5. Verify service accessibility and performance

Phase 2 - Configuration Reset (2-3 minutes):
1. If restart fails, validate configuration: ./startup.sh --validate
2. Restore last known good configuration if corruption detected
3. Regenerate dynamic configurations (CloudFlare IPs, etc.)
4. Restart services with validated configuration
5. Perform comprehensive health check

Phase 3 - Resource Recovery (3-5 minutes):
1. If resource exhaustion detected, perform cleanup:
   - Log rotation: truncate large log files
   - Docker cleanup: docker system prune -f
   - Memory cleanup: sync && echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
2. Restart services after resource cleanup
3. Monitor resource usage for stability

Recovery Validation:
✅ HTTP endpoints returning 200 status
✅ Database queries executing within normal timeframe (<50ms)
✅ User authentication functioning correctly
✅ Admin panel accessible with valid token
✅ SSL certificates valid and trusted
✅ Monitoring systems reporting healthy status
```

#### **Manual Service Recovery**
```bash
# When automated recovery fails, manual intervention required
# Execute as root on the VaultWarden server

Manual Recovery Procedure:

Step 1: Immediate Assessment (2 minutes)
cd /opt/VaultWarden-OCI-Minimal
./tools/monitor.sh --comprehensive-check > /tmp/recovery-assessment-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# Review output for:
# - Service status and health
# - Resource availability
# - Configuration validity  
# - Database accessibility
# - Network connectivity

Step 2: Create Recovery Backup (1 minute)
./tools/create-full-backup.sh --recovery --preserve-state

Step 3: Progressive Recovery Actions
# Level A: Simple Restart
docker compose down
./startup.sh

# Level B: Configuration Reset (if Level A fails)
source lib/config.sh
_load_configuration
./startup.sh --validate
./startup.sh

# Level C: Clean Rebuild (if Level B fails)  
docker compose down
docker system prune -f
docker compose pull
./startup.sh

# Level D: Database Integrity Check (if Level C fails)
./tools/sqlite-maintenance.sh --integrity-check
# If corruption detected, proceed to Level 3 recovery

Step 4: Recovery Validation
./tools/monitor.sh --post-recovery-validation

Expected validation results:
✅ All containers healthy and responsive
✅ VaultWarden accessible at https://vault.yourdomain.com  
✅ Admin panel accessible with correct token
✅ Database queries executing normally
✅ SSL certificates valid
✅ Users can log in and access vault data
```

### **Level 3: Database Recovery**

#### **Database Corruption Recovery**
```bash
# Database corruption detected or suspected
# Critical: Stop VaultWarden immediately to prevent further corruption

Database Recovery Procedure:

Step 1: Immediate Service Protection (1 minute)
docker compose stop vaultwarden
echo "$(date): Database corruption detected - VaultWarden stopped" >> /var/log/disaster-recovery.log

Step 2: Database Assessment (5 minutes)
./tools/sqlite-maintenance.sh --comprehensive-analysis

# Database integrity check
sqlite3 /var/lib/*/data/bwdata/db.sqlite3 "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# Expected outcomes:
# - "ok" = Database is healthy (false alarm)
# - Error messages = Corruption confirmed, proceed with recovery
# - Cannot open database = Severe corruption, restore from backup

Step 3: Backup Current State (2 minutes)
# Even corrupted database may contain recoverable data
cp -p /var/lib/*/data/bwdata/db.sqlite3 /tmp/corrupted-db-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sqlite3
./tools/create-full-backup.sh --corrupted-state --preserve-evidence

Step 4: Recovery Method Selection

Method A: Database Repair (if minor corruption)
./tools/sqlite-maintenance.sh --emergency-repair

# Repair operations:
# - SQLite recovery commands (.recover)
# - Index rebuilding (REINDEX)
# - Statistics update (ANALYZE)
# - Integrity verification

Method B: Backup Restoration (if repair fails)
./tools/restore.sh --database-only --latest-verified

# Restoration process:
# 1. Select most recent verified backup
# 2. Restore database file
# 3. Verify integrity of restored database
# 4. Restart VaultWarden service
# 5. Validate user data accessibility

Method C: Data Recovery (if no recent backup)
./tools/database-recovery.sh --emergency-extraction

# Advanced recovery:
# 1. Extract readable data from corrupted database
# 2. Create new clean database structure
# 3. Import recovered data
# 4. Validate data consistency
# 5. Alert users about potential data loss

Step 5: Recovery Validation (10 minutes)

New Server Deployment:
1. Deploy new Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server
   - Minimum: 2GB RAM, 20GB storage, 1 vCPU
   - Recommended: 4GB RAM, 50GB storage, 2 vCPU
   - Network: Public IP, ports 22/80/443 accessible

2. Basic server setup:
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install git curl wget

3. SSH access configuration:
   # Copy SSH keys or configure new access
   # Verify root/sudo access available

4. DNS configuration:
   # Update DNS A record to point to new server IP
   # If using CloudFlare, update DNS in dashboard
   # Wait for DNS propagation (5-15 minutes typical)

Phase 2: VaultWarden Installation (15-30 minutes)

1. Download VaultWarden-OCI-Minimal:
   cd /opt
   sudo git clone https://github.com/killer23d/VaultWarden-OCI-Minimal.git
   cd VaultWarden-OCI-Minimal
   sudo chmod +x startup.sh tools/*.sh

2. Basic system setup:
   sudo ./tools/init-setup.sh --disaster-recovery

   # Disaster recovery mode:
   # - Installs dependencies quickly
   # - Skips interactive configuration (uses defaults)
   # - Prepares for configuration restoration
   # - Sets up minimal security (can enhance later)

Phase 3: Configuration and Data Restoration (30-60 minutes)

1. Restore configuration and data:
   # Method A: From off-site backup
   ./tools/restore.sh --disaster-recovery /path/to/offsite/backup.tar.gz

   # Method B: From cloud storage
   # Download backup from S3, Google Cloud, etc.
   # Then restore using standard procedure

   # Method C: Manual configuration recreation
   # If no backups available, recreate configuration
   # Will result in data loss - last resort only

2. Configuration validation and updates:
   # Update domain if server IP changed
   sudo nano settings.json  # Update DOMAIN if needed
   
   # Regenerate SSL certificates (automatic via Caddy)
   # Update CloudFlare configuration if needed
   # Verify OCI Vault connectivity if used

3. Service startup and validation:
   ./startup.sh --post-disaster-recovery
   
   # Comprehensive validation:
   ./tools/monitor.sh --disaster-recovery-validation

Phase 4: Service Restoration Validation (15-30 minutes)

User Validation Coordination:
1. Notify all users of service restoration
2. Request each user to log in and verify their data
3. Test critical shared passwords and organization data
4. Verify all devices can sync properly
5. Document any data loss or issues discovered
6. Update users on any required actions

Phase 5: Post-Recovery Hardening (30-60 minutes)

Security Hardening:
- [ ] Review and strengthen firewall rules
- [ ] Update all passwords and tokens (admin token, etc.)
